## Project Title: 
# Package Delivery Optimization

## Description: 
The main goal of this program is to find the shortest route for two trucks to deliver packages. 

This project solves a variation of the travelling salesman problem. 

Each truck travels 18 mph and carries at most 16 packages. 
The combined mileage of both trucks must not exceed 140 miles. 
Each package has a deadline, delay, and/or delivery conditions. 

This project is my submission for a college assignment. 
Thus the addresses, distances, and package deadlines are pre-selected. 
According to directions, the trucks were manually loaded with pre-selected packages. 

## How to Run:
1. Download project files
