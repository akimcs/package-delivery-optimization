# "Package Delivery Optimization"

## Description: 
A Python program that optimizes the delivery route of pre-selected packages (a variation of the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)).

The main goal of this project is to find the shortest route for two trucks to deliver packages. 

**Features:**
* the ability to view the status of each package at any given time of day.
* the ability to add more packages and destination addresses. 

## Project Screenshots:  
For a quick overview of this project, use the [screenshots](/output_screenshots) to see the output of various input times. 

## Setup:
1. Download all project files. 
2. Download PyCharm Community Edition from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download). 
3. Download Python 3 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads). 
4. Run [main.py](/main.py) in PyCharm. 

## How to Use:
1. Input a time of day. 
2. The output will display a status chart of all packages at the given time. 

## Extra Details: 
This project is my submission for a college assignment. 
Thus the addresses, distances, and package deadlines are pre-selected. 
According to directions, the trucks were to be manually loaded with pre-selected packages. 

Each truck travels 18 mph and carries at most 16 packages. 

Both trucks must not exceed 140 miles combined. 

Each package has a deadline, delay, and/or delivery conditions.
